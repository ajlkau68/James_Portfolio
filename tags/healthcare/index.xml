      <description>Project Overview:
Blue Hart Hospital is a fictitious medical facility located in a bustling urban area, known for providing a wide range of healthcare services including emergency care, surgeries, diagnostics, outpatient treatments, and specialized care. The hospital is experiencing a significant rise in complaints related to long patient wait times across various departments. This issue is leading to decreased patient satisfaction, potential loss of revenue, and harm to the hospitalâ€™s public image.</description>
